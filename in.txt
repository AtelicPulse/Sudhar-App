9.	Detail description of the invention:   
1.	Technical Field 
The invention relates to an AI-powered waste management system that enables citizens to report waste-related issues (e.g., overflowing bins, illegal dumping) via a mobile application. The system integrates AI Models along with route optimization, and gamified incentives to improve municipal cleanliness while reducing operational costs. 
2.	Background & Problem Statement 
Traditional waste management systems encounter challenges such as: 
●	Inefficient monitoring (manual inspections, IoT sensor limitations). 
●	Low public participation (no incentives for reporting). 
●	Delayed response times (unoptimized collection routes). 
Existing solutions (e.g., sensor-based smart bins) are costly, hardware-dependent, and fail to address street-level waste. This invention solves these issues through a software-first, crowdsourced approach. 
3.	Invention Components & Workflow 
(A) Citizen Reporting Module 
1.	Functionality: 
Citizens can report new images, check previous reports status. Driver will be assigned the route and tasks through Sudhaar App and will after have feature to upload the image to verify. For geotagged images it is integrated with geotagging, embedding GPS coordinates to get the info about the location of report.  
2.	Proposed Validation: 
To train the model on verify of waste image dataset, the dataset will replicate the situations of different kind in both urban as well as rural areas.   
  
(B)	AI Verification Engine 
●	Process: 
The Vision Transformer model is used to verify and categorize the images. 
1.	Classify Waste types (Organic, Plastic, etc) 
2.	Filter False waste reports ((e.g., irrelevant/non-waste images 
3.	Validate submissions before awarding “Swachh Points.” 
4.	Sending Waste request to the Sudhaar Authority Portal. 
  
●	Proposed Experimentation: 
 
The training of the AI Model is based on the each and every ambiguous case and accurate resolution even in complex situations, model’s ability to identify positive images (waste images) from annotated images. This methodology prioritizes more precision.  
(C)	Municipal Authority Dashboard Features: 
1.	Real-time marked-map (using Mapbox) to visualize reported waste locations. 
2.	Route optimization (via OSRM or similar algorithms) to streamline driver assignments. 
3.	Task management: Municipal Authorities will be responsible to assign the clean-up task. Our approach include manual intervention just to create a realistic and responsible environment. Manager will assign tasks and verify completion. 
 
(D)	Incentivization Mechanism 
●	‘ Swachh Points’ System: 
Whenever a responsible citizen will report the image of waste he or she will be rewarded with “Swatchh Points ( points for each valid report) ”. These points will be credited only if the image contains waste that it should be a genuine request.This credits could be converted into tax benefits at year end with collaboration and support of government. Overall this incentivization approach will create engagement of citizen to foster the cleaning initiatives.  

4. Proposed Technical Validation 
(A) AI Model Development 
●	Dataset: Will compile waste images under varied conditions (lighting, angles, waste types). 
●	Evaluation Metrics: Standard CV metrics (precision, recall) will assess model performance. 
●	Edge Cases: Low-confidence predictions will be routed for manual review. 
(B)	Route Optimization Testing: 
 The system generates optimized waste collection routes using OSRM algorithms, which is provides to driver side, prioritizing AI-verified reports and real-time traffic data. Drivers receive dynamic, turn-by-turn navigation with visual cues for urgent sites. Performance is tracked via GPS to continuously refine routes based on distance, fuel use, and cleanup efficiency. 
(C)	User Adoption Framework: 
 Surveys/Focus Groups: Will gauge citizen motivation (e.g., Swachh Points appeal) before rollout. 
    
10.	Best method of performance of the invention: 
The invention operates through the following steps: 
1.	Citizen Reporting: A user captures an image of overflowing waste or illegal dumping via the Sudhaar mobile app. The app automatically geotags the location and stores the report offline if connectivity is unavailable, syncing data once restored. 
2.	AI Verification: The uploaded image is analyzed by a ResNet-based model trained to classify waste and flag invalid submissions (e.g., irrelevant images). Waste request locations are sent to the Authority dashboard, Valid reports trigger "Swachh Points" for the user, while ambiguous cases are routed for manual review. 
3.	Municipal Action: Authorities access verified reports on a dashboard, where reports are marked on marked-maps (Mapbox) and optimized routes (OSRM), guides the driver to cleanup sites that is the assigned request to drivers. Drivers must submit proof-of-resolution images to close the loop. 
Example: A citizen snaps a photo of a littered park in Mumbai. The AI confirms it as valid waste, awards points, send a request to the dashboard on which the manager can assign those request as a task lets say Task one of a sector 1 in Mumbai. After it the driver will get the most optimized route to complete that Task1 and then he or she should upload the proof image to get reverified by AI and only then the status of that request will be updated in the database. 

10.	  Claims: 
  
1.	A waste management system: 
Our system of multiple interconnected components, specifically designed to enhance current waste dumping scenario. 
An app for the citizens and drivers to report and complete the image request respectively as, the citizens whenever want to generate a clean request she or he should upload the image of that waste area or waste bin throught Sudhaar App and after it the request will be generated to clean the area of that geotagged image, which can be seen on the driver’s side in order to complete it he or she should post the image after cleaning that area using Sudhaar App.

2.	Routes are constantly adjusted in real-time using OSRM algorithms and sent to driver devices as the most efficient paths. 
6.	A closed - loop system:  
1.	Cleanup drivers are required to provide geotagged proof-of-resolution images after finishing their assigned tasks. 
2.	The submitted images are compared to the original waste reports using geographic coordinates to ensure completion of assigned task Reports are closed only after successful confirmation of the completion of the cleanup process. 


12.	Abstract:  
In order to solve the problem of waste dumped openly on ground/street and overflowing bins, we proposed a robust closed loop waste management system that ensure the waste dumped on any area getting cleaned within 4 to 8 hours after reporting it.  
Here is the abstract of this idea, the system will have citizen for reporting illegal waste dumping thought an App (Sudhaar) after uploading this image this image will be validated by AI and after that if it is a genuine image i.e if it contains waste then credits will be credited to the citizen who reported that waste area in form of Swatchh Points (gamified incentives to create engagement). 
Whenever a request is raised that can be seen on the Sudhaar Autority dashboard of the manager  (higher cleaning authorities) now he will assign those requests as tasks to driver (cleaners) along with a most optimized route to be followed to clean all that task in a particular city. This smart waste management system reduces the need of expensive IoT based solution because of crowd-sourcing through Sudhaar App.  
Notable features of the proposed solution are, The Closed–loop system (Citizen – Driver – Manager) ensures guaranteed issues i.e. report resolution. Citizen Incentivization model (credits after each genuine reporting of overflowing bins and illegal dumping areas.
