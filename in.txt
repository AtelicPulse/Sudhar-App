The invention comprises: 
1.	Mobile App (‘Sudhaar’): 
The citizen side app allows user to click and upload image (report waste) and track status of their complaints. These images go to ML model to check waste status. 
Driver side app allows user to see the task assigned to them , the optimized route to complete the task and then upload image of cleaned space to reverify that task is completed
2.	Authority Portal: The Portal tracks problem areas, assigns cleanup tasks, and confirms their successful completion.
3.	AI/ML Models: ResNet/Vit for image classification and LLM for alert generation. 
4.	Incentive System: ‘Swachh Points’ linked to tax benefits.


Abstract:  
In order to solve the problem of waste dumped openly on ground/street and overflowing bins, we proposed a robust closed loop waste management system that ensure the waste dumped on any area getting cleaned within 4 to 8 hours after reporting it.  
Here is the abstract of this idea, the system will have citizen for reporting illegal waste dumping thought an App (Sudhaar) after uploading this image this image will be validated by AI and after that if it is a genuine image i.e if it contains waste then credits will be credited to the citizen who reported that waste area in form of Swatchh Points (gamified incentives to create engagement). 
Whenever a request is raised that can be seen on the Sudhaar Autority dashboard of the manager  (higher cleaning authorities) now he will assign those requests as tasks to driver (cleaners) along with a most optimized route to be followed to clean all that task in a particular city. This smart waste management system reduces the need of expensive IoT based solution because of crowd-sourcing through Sudhaar App.  
Notable features of the proposed solution are, The Closed–loop system (Citizen – Driver – Manager) ensures guaranteed issues i.e. report resolution. Citizen Incentivization model (credits after each genuine reporting of overflowing bins and illegal dumping areas.
